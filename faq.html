                    <p>The Superclinic (SC) and the Extended Day Camp (EDC) differ from a 5-day camp experience
                    by time, finances, content, etc. The Extended Day Camp (EDC) accommodates campers residing
                    at their own residence; however, we feel this detracts from the benefits of a residential,
                    collegiate experience. The Superclinic (SC) is basically a '1/2 camp' catering to a variety
                    of demographic groups who are unable to attend the longer 5-day experience. </p>

                        <p>It promotes environmental, social and college-prep skills, while allowing
                        campers to keep within an intense and changing schedule. Based on my 25 years
                        of experience, we recommend an awesome residendial experience vs an Extended
                        Day Camper. However, we fully understand family needs and can make
                        either the residential or Extended Day Camper experience work well with your child.</p>

                        <p>Traditionally, we host 2 Extended Day Camper per week. They usually make instant,
                        awesome, lifetime tennis friends. Our Extended Day Campers are invited to come 'hang out'
                        Sunday evening - Monday morning through lunch and dinner. Attending camp with a friend
                        is the ideal way to establish a pre-camp comfort level, but this is non-essential because
                        our experience is that kids 'break the ice' and meet people rapidly.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Experience has shown us that 30 hours of tennis and tennis-related off-court activities is 
                        simply too much for a beginner. Local clinics are better for first-year players/beginners to
                        maintain and improve their interest in our favorite lifetime sport! Committing to a full week
                        of tennis camp has its risks. The Superclinic is a consideration for beginner players as is playing
                        locally this year and coming to the Intense Tennis Camp next year!</p>

                           <p> Historically, several campers participate in both and return to repeat
                            the following year. Is it advisable? That is your choice, and certainly involve
                            your child in this decision. Personally, I like the idea of taking the camp learning
                            experience onto the tournament courts, and perhaps repeating this. Is it too repetitive?
                            Definitely not. There is a lot happening both on and off court with different people.</p>

                            <p>We have experience 90+ degree temperatures and other heat-related conditions. At the courts,
                            we prodive ample water, Gatorade, ice, shade, cooling fans and help. To beat the heat, before camp,
                            practive in the hottest conditions you can create to be best ready for possible extreme temperature ranges.
                            Ensure you are properly hydrated before each practive by drinking plenty of water and Gatorade. Drink 4-8oz
                            every break. Do not wait until you feel thirsty. During matchplay, use the full 25 seconds between points and 90
                            seconds on the changeover to hydrate, recover, shade and towel off. Never walk directly to the other side without
                            rest. Realize that your opponent could also feel hot and exhausted. If you are the fitter player, be prepared
                            to play longer points. To help stay cool, wear a hat/visor/bandana, light-colored shirt and sunglasses. Use sunscreen
                            regularly and generously. At the courts, we supply unlimited water, Gatorade and Crystal Light and give you a travelling water bottle.
                            On site, we have sports medicine personnel, tents, sheds, trees, cooling fans and ice to provide shade and first aid

                           <p> Camper (and Counselor/Director) health and safety is our <b>#1 concern</b>. Obviously, at the courts, we
                            can observe all campers at all time. We chaperone all meals at the cafeteria and assign our tennis staff at all open
                            times at the suites. In addition, at the suites, SRU staff are on duty <b>24/7</b> to host campers and provide building
                            security. Also, the swipe keys issued to us provide 3 layers of key-controlled access to the suites. </p>

                            <p>Campers are required to wear their SRU-issued key landyards at all times. Please be aware the suites have 
                            many security cameras. Our tennis staff, including the director, resides in the suites. Our staff meets constantly
                            amd are well-connected with current technology. Consistent and orderly 'head-counts' are conducted on the campers at least 10 times per day, as well as
                            a well-planned 'lockdown' at bedtime. Please understand SRU is not a 'sterile' campus; rather, it is located
                            on 600+ rolling acres of open space; however we have never had a 'reportable incident' in 25 years of camp... and 
                            we plan on maintaining this record. We sometimes use Grove City College's courts 8 miles away and possibly may use 
                            local amenities. These trips are optional. Both staff and campers are trained with an "Emergency Action (Preparedness) Plan (EAP)"
                            in the unlikely event of a severe weather emergency. Your kids are safe with us and we are always open-minded for any improvements.</p>

                        <p>Initially, campers register as 'Intermediate', 'Advanced Intermediate', 'Advanced', or 'Tournament'. This information
                        is collected and given strong consideration. Campers are observed by the full-staff on Sunday evening and placed in
                        color-coded groups for the Monday morning teaching session. Monday afternoon, ideally, campers play 2 mini-matches and this 
                        new data allows us to objectively change the groups for Tuesday morning. And this process is repeated Tuesday afternoon thus
                        changing Wednesday's morning assignments. There is constant change and ideally, daily, each kid plays 2 opponents within their
                        'range'. We rent courts in the afternoon at Grove City College/H.S. to accommodate maximum singles play.</p>

                            <p>Having hosted 8-9-10 year olds in the past, we feel there are risks involved with most under 11 year olds at
                            week-long, overnight camps. To keep these youngsters in tennis for life, we feel that 11 years old is the opening
                            age for the residential camps. One exception is when the 10 year old has an older same-gender sibling as his or her 
                            roommate. Also, we must be fair to the 11-18 year old campers.</p>
